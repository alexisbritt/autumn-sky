# Autumn Sky

A favorite part of the fall for me is the darkening of the sky; it happens earlier everyday and really sets mother nature into a restful state. It may not be the most condusive for work because it just makes you want to curl up in bed and call it a day too but I love seeing that shift happen. So I wanted to just make something that echoes the night sky in code.
