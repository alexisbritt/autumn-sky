# Changing of the Seasons

The leaves are changing colors on the trees, farmers are harvesting their crops, and itâ€™s almost daylight savings time. So, for this two part assignment you and a partner will be creating an interactive piece around the changing of the seasons. It does not need to be only focused on fall, it can include all 4 seasons or focus on your favorite. **This week you will finish your interactive piece.**

### 1. Map out the components for your piece and determine your code structure

**Example:**
##### Our project has:
 * Color Palettes
  * Colors for each season
 * Animations 
  * spring, summer, winter, fall
  * Tween for the Sun and moon
  * Particle system for leaves, snow, dust
 * Interactions: mouse, touch, sound, and/or video
 * Sound effects and music

##### Our code will need:
 * An a object literal or [module](http://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern/)
  * color palette for each season
  * tweens for each animation
  * Variables for the season being displayed, is it night time or daytime, etc..
 * A [particle system](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/) for our leaves and snow using two.js
  * Particle will take 3 images for each leaf or snowflake
  * System will have wind and gravity
  * Randomly positioned on x starting above the screen
  * Masses will be random so the fall at different speeds
 * A sound object that will load into the animation library
 * An interaction object for mouse and keyboard

### 2. Assign tasks to each other of who will designing, building, coding.
* Team member one:
 * Sound effects
 * Interactions with keyboard
 * Particle system
* Team member two:
 * Artwork
 * Animations 

### 3. Code it!
 * Drive the project using p5.js
 * Use additional libraries that fit your story
  * p5.sound.js
  * dat.GUI
  * tween.js
  * two.js
  * other libraries you would like to try!

### 5. Upload it to github:
 * Update and complete your readme.md
 * Commit to a gh-pages branch to host the project

## Submission Guidelines for Part 2 of 2
* All of the tasks from Part 1
* Code plan
* Coded and finished piece committed to Github
